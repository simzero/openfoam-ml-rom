# pitzDaily

Workflow for solving a steady turbulent flow over a backward-facing step. This case is based on the OpenFOAM [pitzDaily tutorial](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/tutorial-guide/3-compressible-flow/3.1-steady-turbulent-flow-over-a-backward-facing-step) with parametrized inlet velocity and kinematic viscosity for a turbulence intensity of 5%.

Usage:

```
./Allrun ${cores}

e.g.:

./Allrun 30
```
